## My process

I didn't do anything new just apply simple below process - 
- Learn : I have learnt required skills for this project. i.e. React JS, SCSS 
- Practice : Try to understand the react js concept, didn't go smooth as a starter but now understanding the concept due to daily practice.
- Implement : I have implemented all that, I have learnt to make this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I have learnt two major things while working in this project.
- Now, I'm able to dynamically change the style of the components according to their required styles.
- And last, react props and states which seems to be easier but actually it's quite difficult to understand.

### Continued development

I found styled component more usefull, I have learnt it but couldn't implemented will implement it in future projects and currently, I would like to focus basically on react concepts i.e. props and react hooks.
